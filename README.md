# Droll To-Do List 📋

Welcome to **Droll To-Do List**, a simple, clean, and interactive to-do list application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Keep track of your tasks with ease—add new tasks, check off completed ones, and delete tasks you no longer need! All data is saved locally using `localStorage` for a seamless experience across sessions.

## Features 
- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks through the input box and button.
- **Mark as Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed, visually striking through the text.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks by clicking the 'X' button next to them.
- **Local Storage**: Your tasks are saved even after you refresh the page or revisit the site.

## Project Structure 📂
The project has the following file structure:

```
├── Images
│   ├── checked.png
│   ├── icon.png
│   └── unchecked.png
├── index.html
├── script.js
└── style.css
```

### Images
- `checked.png`: Icon for completed tasks.
- `icon.png`: Logo of the application.
- `unchecked.png`: Icon for pending tasks.

### HTML (`index.html`)
The main structure of the To-Do list app, including:
- A header with navigation links.
- A task input box and add button.
- A list container to display tasks.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)
Handles the core functionality:
- Add, check, and delete tasks.
- Data persistence using `localStorage`.

### CSS (`style.css`)
Styles the to-do list, including layout, colors, fonts, and animations for smooth interactions.

## How It Works 🔧

### 1. Adding a Task
- Type your task in the input box and press the **"Add"** button, or hit **Enter**.
- The task will appear in the list below.

### 2. Marking a Task as Completed
- Click on any task to toggle its completion. This will strike through the task and change its style.

### 3. Deleting a Task
- Click the 'X' button next to any task to delete it.

### 4. Data Persistence
- Tasks are saved to your browser's `localStorage` so that they persist across page refreshes and browser sessions.

### 5. Responsive Design
- The app has been styled to be responsive, so it works on both desktop and mobile devices.
